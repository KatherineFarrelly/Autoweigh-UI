# Autoweigh UI
 UI for the Automated soil weighing robot

# What is this code?
Glad you asked. This is the UI for the Automated Soil Weighing System Robot nicknamed Autoweigh 2020.
Right now there is only source code, however when the UI is finished there will be some executable file that can be downloaded here to run the UI instead of having to run the Python script yourself.
